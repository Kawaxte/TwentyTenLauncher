This repository contains an application that lets you play older versions of Minecraft. It's named
after the year the original Minecraft Launcher was released, and is
designed to give you an authentic experience of playing Minecraft as it was in the past.

## Features

- Play different versions of Minecraft from the past; from February 2010 up to
  September 2011.
- Hear the classic sounds of Minecraft, like the scary cave sounds and the infamous hurt sound.
- Join servers that still run older versions of Minecraft, and see your skin or cape (_if the
  version
  supports it_) in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
- Use legacy mods just like you would in the past - just drag and drop `.class` files into the
  client `.jar` file, provided that you have ModLoader installed first.
- Change the language of the launcher without having to restart the application.
