This project lets you play older versions of Minecraft that were released between June 2010 and
January 2011. It's named after the year the original Minecraft launcher was released, and it's
designed to give you an authentic experience of playing Minecraft as it was in the past.

## Features

- Play different versions of Minecraft from the past, including versions from June 2010 up to
  January 2011.

- Hear the classic sounds of Minecraft, like the scary cave sounds and the infamous hurt sound.
- Join servers that still run older versions of Minecraft, and see your skin or cape (_if the
  version
  supports it_) in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
- Use legacy mods just like you would in the past - just drag and drop `.class` files into the
  client `.jar` file, provided that you have ModLoader installed first.
- Change the language of the launcher without having to restart the application.
