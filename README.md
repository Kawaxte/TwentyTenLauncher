This repository contains an application that allows users to play legacy versions of Minecraft that
were released between June 2010 and January 2011. It's called "TwentyTen" because that's the year
the original _Minecraft_ Launcher first released to the public, and is based on a November 2010
build of that launcher.

With _TwentyTen Launcher_, you can log in with your Mojang or Microsoft account and choose from
different languages and versions of Minecraft to play. However, it's important to note that the game
itself is only available in English, regardless of the language setting. The goal of this project is
to provide an authentic experience of what it was like to
play Minecraft in the far past.
