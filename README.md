__TwentyTen Launcher__ is a third-party Minecraft launcher that offers a selection of legacy
Minecraft
versions from June 2010 and January 2011. It is named after the year the original launcher was
released and is based on the November 2010 build of the original launcher.

With this launcher, you can sign in with your Mojang or Microsoft account and choose different
languages and legacy versions of Minecraft to play. The launcher is designed to give you an
authentic experience of playing the game as it was in the past.

> Please note that this application needs at least Java 7 or a newer version to run.
